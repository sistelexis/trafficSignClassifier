    "## Rubric Points\n",
    "Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Load the data set (see below for links to the project data set)\n",
    "One important detail was to load, besides the images and the labels, the zoom information in order to use it later for data augmentation.\n",
    "![original data set](readmeImg/dataSetSample.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explore, summarize and visualize the data set\n",
    "The data sets have the following amount of images:\n",
    "* Number of training examples = 34799\n",
    "* Number of validation examples = 4410\n",
    "* Number of testing examples = 12630\n",
    "* Images are 32 x 32 RGB.\n",
    "* There are 43 different signs type.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the data sets, we can easily see that image count per sign class is very uneven. In fact, some signs are represented over 10 times more than others. That distribution is the same on all the three data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image distribution by class](readmeImg/imgDistPerType.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design, train and test a model architecture\n",
    "In order to feed the model, the first step was to pre-process the images.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Although I have tried several approaches, I finally decided to simply use a grayscale conversion, followed by the normalization.\n",
    "With that action, I intended to focus on finetuning the model parameters. For instance, I realized that the histogram equalization was having a strange effect like removing a lot of information, and having an effect like a dropout, but in a way not as random as a dropout, and that affected the results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, some speed limit signs could totally loose the number.  \n",
    "The bellow images shows different states of processing that led me to choose only grayscale. In order to show the effects of the pre-processing, I choose some images heavily affected by it (list order matches columns):  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Original color image\n",
    "2. Grayscale transformation\n",
    "3. Equalized histogram\n",
    "4. Sharpen over grayscale\n",
    "5. Sharpen over equalized histogram\n",
    "\n",
    "![pre-processing tests](readmeImg/preProcAnalysis.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "On the code notebook other tests can be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next step was the data augmentation, and I did it in two sub-steps.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Since I had the right zoom information from the data set, I simply duplicated the amount of images using that information.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, in order to level the number of images per sign class, I randomly applied rotation, translation, distortion and brightness adjustment, to each sign type until each one reached 2020 x 2 images (a little bit over the counting of the most represented sign, after being duplicated using the zoom). That created a total number of images of around 175k.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, starting from the suggested LeNet model, that was from scratch only a few 4 or 5% away from the required value (I must admit, that later I have to fight it hard to get there. So those few turned out to be a lot), I started my learning process to understand how the model would manage to achieve the required test accuracy of 93%.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To train the model, I made some tests to identify an acceptable learning rate, using the batch size of 128 already coming from the LeNet project. I also maintained the Adam Optimizer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I then understood that I should overfit the model. To achieve it, I started adding filters to the existing layers and started seeing some good improvements. Then I finally added a third convolution layer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The final model has one more convolution (3x3) than the LeNet, more filters, and two dropouts after fully connected layers (0 and 1).  \n",
    "\n",
    "My final model consisted of the following layers:\n",

    "I would now say that the best approach is to keep it as simple as possible, and then step by step to chase a huge training accuracy. That huge value, once found, can be \"shared\" with the validation, with the help of dropouts, allowing a suitable value based on the project requirements.  \n",
